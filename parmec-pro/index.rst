PARMEC-PRO
==========

**Website:** https://parmec-pro.tk (not yet active)

**Blog authors:** `Tomek <../blog/author/tomek.html>`_

**Kind:** proprietary, open-source

PARMEC-PRO is a descendant of `PARMEC <../parmec>`_ and `SOLFEC <../solfec>`_ codes, currently under development.
The idea is to try and mix open-source and proprietary paradigms in a way that could work for users and developers:)
