PARMEC-PRO
==========

**Website:** https://parmec-pro.tk (not yet active)

**Blog authors:** `Tomek <../blog/author/tomek.html>`_

**Kind:** proprietary

PARMEC-PRO is a proprietary descendant of `PARMEC <../parmec>`_ and `SOLFEC <../solfec>`_ codes, currently under development.
This is something that I would like to try, as there is an unexpressed energy of this kind in my makeup. This thread of work
may merge back with PARMEC at some point:)
