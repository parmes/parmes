About PARMES
============

Hi:) This website is an outlet for ideas and resources in the area of parallel computational mechanics
and particulate media software. On and off, I have been working on one such software, :ref:`solfec-index`,
which you will find gradually better documented here. There are also other computational codes and libraries,
which I would like to develop, share and write about. Some of those are included in the Navigation area.
`Here you will find a profile related to my education and work. <http://www.linkedin.com/in/tkoziara>`_

You are welcome to join PARMES blog as an author as well as join software development. You are also welcome if
you would like to contribute your own code to this project. `Do contact me. <../contact.html>`_ All are welcome:)
Tomek.
