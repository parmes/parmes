About PARMES
============

Hi. This website is an outlet for ideas and resources in the area of parallel computational mechanics
and particulate media software. On and off, I have been working on one such software, :ref:`solfec-index`,
which you will find gradually better documented here. There are also other computational codes and libraries,
that I would like to share and write about. Some of those are included in the Navigation area.

`Here you will find a profile related to my education and work. <http://www.linkedin.com/in/tkoziara>`_
My other website, about waking up from the experience of separation, `can be found here. <http://m21s.tk>`_
Parmes website is written using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ generator,
`alabaster <http://alabaster.readthedocs.io>`_ theme, and `ablog <http://ablog.readthedocs.io>`_ extension.
