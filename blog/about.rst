Hi:) This website is an outlet for ideas and resources in the area of programming parallel computational
mechanics, multi-body analysis and particulate media software. On and off, I have been working on one
such software, :ref:`solfec-1.0-index`, which you will find gradually better documented here. There are also
other computational codes and libraries, which I would like to share about. Some of those are included in
the Navigation area. See also: `Linkedin <http://www.linkedin.com/in/tkoziara>`_ and `Researchgate
<https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomasz_Koziara>`_ profiles. Donate: `Liberapay <https://liberapay.com/Tomek>`_.
