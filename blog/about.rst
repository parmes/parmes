About PARMES
============

Hi:) This website is an outlet for ideas and resources in the area of programming parallel computational
mechanics, multi-body analysis and particulate media software. On and off, I have been working on one
such software, :ref:`solfec-index`, which you will find gradually better documented here. There are also
other computational codes and libraries, which I would like to share about. Some of those are included in
the Navigation area.

You are welcome to join PARMES blog as an author, as well as contribute or reference on this website
software that you develop or support. `Do contact me <../contact.html>`_. All are welcome:) Tomek.

(PARMES website is written using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ generator,
`alabaster <http://alabaster.readthedocs.io>`_ theme, and `ablog <http://ablog.readthedocs.io>`_ extension)
