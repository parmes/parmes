About PARMES
============

Hi. This website is an outlet for ideas and resources in the area of parallel computational mechanics
and particulate media software.  On and off, I have been working on one such software, :ref:`solfec-about`,
which you will find gradually better documented here.

There are also other, smaller computational codes and libraries, that I would like to share and write about.
Placeholders for some of those are included in the Navigation area.

Parmes is written using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ generator,
`alabaster <http://alabaster.readthedocs.io>`_ theme, and `ablog <http://ablog.readthedocs.io>`_ extension.
