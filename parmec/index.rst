Parmec is a prototype of a vectorized and task based discrete element software, implemented using
`ISPC <http://ispc.github.io>`_ and C++. This code is at an early stage of development and it is
only partially functional (see :ref:`implementation status <parmec-implementation_status>`). Parmec
can be used as a blueprint of a `DEM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_element_method>`_ code
implemented predominately in `ISPC <http://ispc.github.io>`_.
