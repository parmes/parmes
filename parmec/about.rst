Parmec is a prototype of a vectorized and task based discrete element software, implemented using ISPC and C++.
This code is at an early stage of development and it is not functional yet. Nonetheless,
it can be used as it is now, as a blueprint of a `DEM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_element_method>`_
code implemented predominately in `ISPC <http://ispc.github.io>`_.
