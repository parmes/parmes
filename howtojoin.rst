How to join?
------------

To join this blog as an author you will need:

  * an installation of `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_, including:

    * `Pillow <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.3.x/>`_ library

    * `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ generator

    * `alabaster <http://alabaster.readthedocs.io>`_ theme

    * and `ablog <http://ablog.readthedocs.io>`_ extension,

  * an installation of `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_,

  * and a `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ account.

Once all this is set up:

  1. Fork `PARMES repository <https://github.com/parmes/parmes/>`_ on GitHub
     (`guide page one <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`_
     and `two <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_).

  2. Learn `basics of reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_.

  3. Write a page summarising the software package that you would like to share about
     (e.g. in analogy to `parmes.org/solfec <./solfec>`_; `see page source <./_sources/solfec/index.rst.txt>`_).

  4. Include yourself on the `authors page <./authors.html>`_ (`see page source <./_sources/authors.rst.txt>`_).

  5. Write a blog post (`see existing examples <https://github.com/parmes/parmes/tree/master/blog>`_).

  6. Type *make* in the root directory of your cloned PARMES sources. This compiles the website
     and generates html code inside of the *_build/html* subdirectory. You can view the results
     using your web browers by opening *_build/html/index.html* file. Typically you will make
     many edits and recompile the sources several times before you are satisfied with the result.
     Once you are satisfied:

  6. Submit a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>`_ 
     (`guide page <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>`_).

Later you will be able to edit and improve your posts and pages. The whole process becomes
smooth and habituated with time. I will be there with you, communicating via GitHub messages
and emails, in case you needed assistance:)
