**Abstract** |br|
Pattern formation for a constrained one--dimensional assembly comprising a number of blocks undergoing external harmonici
excitation of the basin boundary is investigated. The importance of the relationship between the excitation amplitude and
the basin size which leads to repeatable response patterns of the single and multiple blocks is established, considering
in addition the role of the energy dissipation due to inter block collisions and collisions with the moving boundary.
Experimental results for the four-- and eight--block assembly control problems, exposed to a range of amplitudes and frequencies,
are included and compared with the two sets of computational simulation frameworks, the explicit discrete element method and the
non--smooth contact dynamics. In the characterisation of the dynamic sensitivity response of the multiblock assemblies, several
attributes and indices (kinetic energy index, block assembly mass centroid and mass inertia index, presented through time histories
and phase planes) are extracted from both the experimental and computational simulation results and successfully compared.
