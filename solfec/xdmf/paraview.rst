Paraview session example
========================

This section gives an example of a `Paraview <http://www.paraview.org>`_ session involving viewing results
generated by the domino toppling example described in the :ref:`previous section <solfec-xdmf-example>`.
We are not assuming a prior knowledge of Paraview.

Let's start by viewing the results saved into the *out/xmftest0* directory. These were generated in 'WRITE'
mode [1]_ prior to any calculations. Consequently the out/xmftest0 directory only stores the initial geometry
of the problem. Let's open the *\*.xmf* files found inside of this directory by using File :math:`\to` Open and
selecting *xmftest0_grids.xmf* and *xmftest0_spheres.xmf* files. When opening a first of those files you will
be prompted to sellect an XDMF reader -- any of the *Xdmf3 Reader* options will be appropriate, cf. :numref:`paraview-0`.

   XDMF reader selection in Paraview (use any of *Xdmf3* options).



.. [1] Solfec operates either in 'WRITE' mode, computing and writing new results, or in 'READ' mode, reading and post-processing existing results.
