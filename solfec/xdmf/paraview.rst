Paraview session example
========================

This section gives an example of a `Paraview <http://www.paraview.org>`_ session involving viewing results
generated by the domino toppling example described in the :ref:`previous section <solfec-xdmf-example>`.
Although our presentation is self--contained, `Paraview tutotials <http://www.paraview.org/tutorials/>`_ greatly
expand on the minimalist exposition provided herein.

Let's start by viewing the results saved into the *out/xmftest0* directory. These were generated in 'WRITE'
mode [1]_ prior to any calculations. Consequently, *out/xmftest0* only stores the initial geometry
of the problem. Let's open the *\*.xmf* files found inside of this directory by using File :math:`\to` Open and
selecting *xmftest0_grids.xmf* and *xmftest0_spheres.xmf* files. When opening a first of those files you will
be prompted to sellect an XDMF reader. Use any of the *Xdmf3* options, cf. :numref:`paraview-0`.

   :align: center

   XDMF reader selection in Paraview (use any of the *Xdmf3* options).

After opening both the *grids* and the *spheres* files, your application window may look like :numref:`paraview-1`.
Let's select the *Render View* in the "Layout #1" window and click onto the little eye to the left of **xmftest0_grids.xmf** item
in the *Pipeline Browser*. We should now be able to manipulate (pan and rotate by left clicking and moving around) the graphical
representation of the domino model, cf. :numref:`paraview-2`.

The last thing to be done for this results set is to enable the graphical representation of the sphere. To do this we need to
select *xmftest0_spheres.xmf* in the Pipeline Browser, followed by clicking *Apply* in the properties window underneath.
This will cause the glyph icon, |glyph|, to become active allowing us to use a sphere based representation
of the *xmftest0_spheres.xmf*  dataset.

.. [1] Solfec operates either in 'WRITE' mode, computing and writing new results, or in 'READ' mode, reading and post-processing existing results.
