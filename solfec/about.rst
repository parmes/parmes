Solfec implements the Non-Smooth Contact Dynamics Method [1,2] using MPI, C, Python and several 3rd party
codes written in C/C++/Fortran. It includes mesh, convex polyhedra, sphere and ellipsoid based shapes,
linear elastic first order finite elements, pseudo-rigid and rigid kinematics, velocity based Signorini-Coulomb
contact/impact law, and a parallel time stepping combined with a simple dynamic load balancing. Solfec
has been developed as a part of research [3], and it is currently developed and maintained with support
from the civil nuclear context int the UK.
