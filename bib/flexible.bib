	Abstract = {In this paper, a certain class of steady motions of
                   compressible and incompressible isotropic, elastic
                   Cosserat points are examined. We define such a motion
                   as a triad of deformed vectors undergoing a fixed axis
                   rotation at constant angular velocity. We strengthen
                   and extend the results of Cohen, Lewis, Mac Sithigh,
                   Muncaster and Simo, which employ the related theory of
                   a pseudo-rigid body, by proving that the motions they
                   studied encompass the entire class of steady motions
                   which we define. Several new results are established
                   for the steady motions of incompressible Cosserat
                   points which include criteria for the existence of
                   steady motions for all possible values of either an
                   angular momentum or an angular velocity. In the context
                   of neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin Cosserat points, we
                   present and compare the results of two distinct

                   other based on angular momentum) of the steady motions,
                   and show that these motions are non-existent for a
                   range of angular velocities. Further-more, the

                   certain compressible and incompressible Cosserat points
                   is discussed. The results of this paper can be

	Abstract = {This article advocates a general procedure for the
                   numerical investigation of pseudo-rigid bodies. The
                   equations of motion for pseudo-rigid bodies are shown
                   to be mathematically equivalent to those corresponding
                   to certain constant-strain finite element
                   approximations for general deformable continua. A
                   straightforward algorithmic implementation is achieved
                   in a classical finite element framework. Also, a
                   penalty formulation is suggested for modelling contact
                   between pseudo-rigid bodies. Representative planar
                   simulations using a non-linear elastic model
                   demonstrate the predictive capacity of the pseudo-rigid
                   theory, as well as the robustness of the proposed

@article{Casey2004,
	Abstract = {Pseudo-rigid bodies are regarded here as globally
                   constrained three-dimensional homogeneous continua. The
                   constraint reaction stresses play a fundamental role in
                   maintaining the homogeneity of the deformation field in
                   pseudo-rigid bodies, and the theory is formulated in a
                   manner that makes this role explicit. Our derivation of
                   Lagrange's equations is patterned after geometrical
                   derivations recently given for particle systems and
                   rigid bodies. The pseudo-rigid body is represented by
                   an abstract particle P moving in a higher-dimensional
                   Euclidean space, called Hertzian space, the metric of
                   which is determined by the radius of gyration of the
                   body. The dynamical equations for the pseudo-rigid body
                   are transformed into a single balance equation in
                   Hertzian space. In the presence of holonomic
                   constraints, the particle P is confined to move in a
                   manifold, the configuration manifold, imbedded in
                   Hertzian space. The geometry of the configuration
                   manifold is Riemannian. Lagrange's equations emerge as
                   the covariant components of the balance equation taken
                   along the coordinate directions in the configuration
                   manifold. Non-holonomic constraints are also
