	Abstract = {The authors present two geometric descriptions of the
                   frictional properties of a rigid body sliding on a
                   planar surface. The limit surface, from classical
                   plasticity theory, is the boundary of the set of all
                   possible frictional forces and moments that can be
                   sustained by the frictional interface. Zhukovskii's
                   moment function is the frictional moment as a function
                   of the instantaneous center of rotation's location.
                   Both of these descriptions implicitly contain the full
                   relationship between slip motion and frictional load
                   for an object that makes contact governed by a useful
                   class of friction laws that includes Coulomb friction.
                   These surfaces can be used to deduce results concerning
                   the overall frictional motion behavior of rigid bodies,
                   such as the existence of characteristic final slip
                   motion directions.},

	Abstract = {A formulation for the contact forces between curved
                   surfaces in resting (non-colliding) contact is
                   presented. In contrast to previous formulations,
                   constraints on the allowable tangential movement
                   between contacting surfaces are not required. Surfaces
                   are restricted to be twice-differentiable surfaces
                   without boundary. Only finitely many contact points
                   between surfaces are allowed; however, the surfaces
                   need not be convex. The formulation yields the contact
                   forces between curved surfaces and polyhedra as well.
                   Algorithms for performing collision detection during
                   simulation on bodies composed of both polyhedra and
                   strictly convex curved surfaces are also presented. The
                   collision detection algorithms exploit the geometric
                   coherence between successive time steps of the
                   simulation to achieve efficient running times.},

	Abstract = {A model for the dynamic simulation of flexible bodies
                   subject to non-penetration constraints is presented.
                   Flexible bodies are described in terms of global
                   deformations of a rest shape. The dynamical behavior of
                   these bodies that most closely matches the behavior of
                   ideal continuum bodies is derived, and subsumes the
                   results of earlier Lagrangian dynamics-based models.
                   The dynamics derived for the flexible-body model allows
                   the unification of previous work on flexible body
                   simulation and previous work on non-penetrating rigid
                   body simulation. The non-penetration constraints for a
                   a system of bodies that contact at multiple points are
                   maintained by analytically calculated contact forces.
                   An implementation for first- and second-order
                   polynomially deformable bodies is described. The
                   simulation of second-order of higher deformations
                   currently involves a polyhedral boundary approximation

@inproceedings{Mattikalli1993,
	Abstract = {High level assembly plans prescribe the sequence in
                   which parts come together along with their motions. At
                   each stage of assembly the stability of subassemblies
                   is an important concern. In this paper we address the
                   problem of gravitational stability of assemblies of
                   frictionless rigid bodies. Solution methods to the
                   problems of determining if an assembly is stable, and
                   finding a stable orientation for a given assembly are
                   proposed. The solution methods for the two problems
                   compute constrained motions of individual parts that
                   decrease gravitational potential energy, in order to
                   determine stability and search for stable orientations.
                   Linear programming is used to obtain numerical
                   solutions. The problem of finding a stable orientation
                   is formulated as a maximin problem. The solution to
                   this problem is the first general method for
                   automatically determining stable orientations. The
                   program to solve the two problems takes as input a
                   geometric model of the assembly and information related
                   to grounding constraints. Preliminary results are
                   presented.},

	Abstract = {Previous work by Mattikalli et al. [1] considered the
                   stability of assemblies of frictionless contacting
                   bodies with uniform gravity. A linear programming-based
                   technique was described that would automatically
                   determine a single stable orientation for an assembly
                   (if such an orientation existed). In this paper, we
                   give an exact characterization of the entire set of
                   stable orientations of any assembly under uniform
                   gravity. Our characterization reveals that the set of
                   stable orientations maps out a convex region on the
                   unit-sphere of directions. The region is bounded by a
                   sequence of vertices adjoined with great arcs. Linear
                   programming techniques are used to automatically find
                   this set of vertices, yielding a precise description of
                   the range of stable orientations for any frictionless

@article{Mattikalli1995,
	Abstract = {The stability of an assemblage of contacting rigid
                   bodies without friction is investigated. A method is
                   presented for finding an orientation of the assembly so
                   that the assembly remains motionless under gravity. If
                   no stable orientation exists for an assembly, the
                   method finds the `least' unstable orientation. The
                   metric used to measure stability is based on the second
                   time-rate of change of the gravitational potential
                   energy, and the desired orientation for an assembly is
                   expressed in terms of an optimization problem involving
                   changes in potential energy. The problem of finding
                   stable or maximally-stable orientations is formulated
                   as a constrained maximin problem. The maximin problem
                   is shown to be a variant of standard zero-sum matrix
                   games, and can be solved using linear programming. The
                   method is the first general method for automatically
                   determining stable orientations. Example assemblies are

	Abstract = {Current linear-time simulation methods for articulated
                   figures are based exclusively on reduced-coordinate
                   formulations. This paper describes a general,
                   non-iterative linear-time simulation method based
                   instead on Lagrange multipliers. Lagrange multiplier
                   methods are important for computer graphics
                   applications because they bypass the difficult (and
                   often intractable) problem of parameterizing a system's
                   degrees of freedom. Given a loop-free set of n equality
                   constraints acting between pairs of bodies, the method
                   takes O(n) time to compute the system's dynamics. The
                   method does not rely on matrix bandwidth, so no
                   assumptions about the constraints' topology are needed.
                   Bodies need not be rigid, constraints can be of various
                   dimensions, and unlike reduced-coordinate approaches,
                   nonholonomic (e.g. velocity-dependent) constraints are
                   allowed. An additional set of k one-dimensional
                   constraints which induce loops and/or handle
                   inequalities can be accommodated with cost O(kn). This
                   makes it practical to simulate complicated, closed-loop
                   articulated figures with joint-limits and contact at
                   interactive rates. A complete description of a sample
                   implementation is provided in pseudocode.},

	Abstract = {Previous work by Mattikalli et al. [1] considered the
                   stability of assemblies of frictionless contacting
                   bodies under uniform gravity. A linear
                   programming-based technique was described that would
                   automatically determine a single stable orientation for
                   an assembly (if such an orientation existed). In this
                   paper, we include Coulomb friction at contacts between
                   bodies and give a characterization of the entire set of
                   stable orientations of an assembly under uniform
                   gravity. Our characterization is based on the concept
                   of potential stability, which describes a necessary but
                   not sufficient condition for the stability of an
                   assembly. Orientations that are computed as being
                   unstable, however, are guaranteed to fall apart. Our
                   characterization reveals that the set of stable
                   orientations maps out a convex region on the
                   unit-sphere of directions and corresponds to a
                   spherical analog of a planar polygon - the region is
                   bounded by a sequence of vertices joined by great arcs.
                   Linear programming techniques are used to automatically
                   find this set of vertices, yielding a description of
                   the range of stable orientations for any assembly. For
                   frictionless assemblies, our characterization of stable
                   orientations is exact. For assemblies with friction,
                   some conservative approximations associated with the
                   use of a linearized Coulomb law are made.},

More specifically, the proposed scheme preserves a priori stability estimates of the continuum problem for both frictionless and frictional contact, leading to improved numerical stability properties in particular. For the normal contact component, the algorithm exhibits full energy conservation between released states, while the energy does not increase over its initial value due to the enforcement of the normal contact constraint during persistent contact. A penalty regularization is considered to this purpose. A new regularization of the stick conditions is considered for the frictional part. The new scheme is shown rigorously to exhibit positive energy dissipation like the continuum physical problem in this frictional case. Coulomb friction is assumed. Complete analyses of these considerations, as well as a detailed description of their finite element implementation, are included in the general finite deformation range. Representative numerical simulations are presented to assess the performance of the newly proposed methods.},

                   levitation haptic interface device has been integrated
                   with a physically-based dynamic rigid-body simulation
                   to enable realistic user interaction in real time with
                   a 3-D dynamic virtual environment. The user grasps the
                   levitated handle of the device to manipulate a virtual
                   tool in the simulated environment and feels its force
                   and motion response as it contacts and interacts with
                   other objects in the simulation. The physical
                   simulation and the magnetic levitation controller
                   execute independently on separate processors. The
                   position and orientation of the virtual tool in the
                   simulation and the levitated handle of the maglev
                   device are exchanged at each update of the simulation.
                   The position and orientation data from each system act
                   as impedance control setpoints for the other, with
                   position error and velocity feedback on each system
                   acting as virtual coupling between the two systems. The
                   setpoints from the simulation are interpolated by the
                   controller at the faster device control rate so that
                   the user feels smooth sliding contacts without
                   chattering due to the slower updates of the simulation.
                   The simple feedback coupling between the two systems
                   enables the overall stiffness and stability of the
                   combined system to be tuned easily and provides
                   realistic haptic user interaction. Sample task
                   simulation environments have been programmed to

@article{Heinstein1999,
	Abstract = {A contact enforcement algorithm has been developed for
                   matrix-free quasistatic finite element techniques.
                   Matrix-free (iterative) solution algorithms such as
                   non-linear conjugate gradients (CG) and dynamic
                   relaxation (DR) are desirable for large solid mechanics
                   applications where direct linear equation solving is
                   prohibitively expensive, but in contrast to more
                   traditional Newton-Raphson and quasi-Newton iteration
                   strategies, the number of iterations required for
                   convergence is typically of the same order as the
                   number of degrees of freedom of the model. It is
                   therefore crucial that each of these iterations be
                   inexpensive to perform, which is of course the essence
                   of a matrix free method. In applying such methods to
                   contact problems we emphasize here two requirements:
                   first, that the treatment of the contact should not
                   make an average equilibrium iteration considerably more
                   expensive; and second, that the contact constraints
                   should be imposed in such a way that they do not
                   introduce spurious energy that acts against the
                   iterative solver. These practical concerns are utilized
                   to develop an iterative technique for accurate
                   constraint enforcement that is suitable for non-linear
                   conjugate gradient and dynamic relaxation iterative
                   schemes. Copyright ? 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

                   (drilling friction) and spin. The set-valued

	Abstract = {Abstract A new algorithm for solving the
                   three-dimensional elastic contact problem with friction
                   is presented. The algorithm is a non-interior smoothing
                   algorithm based on an NCP-function. The parametric
                   variational principle and parametric quadratic
                   programming method were applied to the analysis of
                   three-dimensional frictional contact problem. The
                   solution of the contact problem was finally reduced to
                   a linear complementarity problem, which was
                   reformulated as a system of nonsmooth equations via an
                   NCP-function. A smoothing approximation to the
                   nonsmooth equations was given by the aggregate
                   function. A Newton method was used to solve the
                   resulting smoothing nonlinear equations. The algorithm
                   presented is easy to understand and implement. The
                   reliability and efficiency of this algorithm are
                   demonstrated both by the numerical experiments of LCP

	Abstract = {In machine dynamics impacts may occur by interaction
                   of solid bodies. There is no doubt that the method of
                   multibody systems is most efficient for the dynamical
                   analysis of the overall motion. However, during impact
                   energy is lost macromechanically measured by the
                   coefficient of restitution. This coefficient has to be
                   estimated from experiments and experience but cannot be
                   computed within the multibody system approach. The
                   impacts, on the other hand, are generating waves in the
                   bodies which are propagating until they are vanishing
                   due to material damping. These high frequency phenomena
                   are analyzed using wave propagation, modal approach and
                   finite elements. The results of the simulation on the
                   fast time scale are used to compute the coefficient of
                   restitution which is then fed back to the multibody
                   system equations and the solution continues on the
                   related slow time scale. The efficiency of the approach
                   presented is shown for the impact of a steel sphere on
                   four different shaped aluminum bodies of comparable
                   mass. The simulation results are verified with
                   experiments performed on different time scales, too.
                   Using the impact of a double pendulum on a stop as
                   example, the application of the multiscale approach to
                   a multibody system is shown.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we provide a full instruction on how to
                   formulate and evaluate planar frictional contact
                   problems in the spirit of non-smooth dynamics. By
                   stating the equations of motion as an equality of
                   measures, frictional contact reactions are taken into
                   account by Lagrangian multipliers. Contact kinematics
                   is formulated in terms of gap functions, and normal and
                   tangential relative velocities. Associated frictional
                   contact laws are stated as inclusions, incorporating
                   impact behavior in form of Newtonian kinematic impacts.
                   Based on this inequality formulation, a linear
                   complementarity problem in standard form is presented,
                   combined with Moreau's time stepping method for
                   numerical integration. This approach has been applied
                   to the woodpecker toy, of which a complete parameter
                   list and numerical results are given in the paper. ?

	Abstract = {A fully covariant description, based on the
                   consideration of contact from the surface geometry
                   point of view, is used for a consistent formulation of
                   frictional contact conditions. All necessary operations
                   for the description of the contact problems:
                   kinematics, all differential operations etc. are
                   defined in the covariant form in the local coordinate
                   system which corresponds to the closest point
                   procedure. The main advantage is a geometrical
                   structure of the full tangent matrix, which is is
                   subdivided into main, rotational and curvature parts.
                   The consistent linearization of the penalty regularized
                   contact integral leads to a symmetrical tangent matrix
                   in the case of sticking. Representative examples show
                   the effectiveness of the approach for problems where
                   the definition of sticking-sliding zones is necessary
                   as well as for the case of fully developed sliding
                   zones.},

Most researchers today focus on numerical methods for solving these systems, because computing times especially for large systems are a problem. Time-stepping schemes for time-integration, pivoting or iterative algorithms for solving the complementarity problem and the Augmented Lagrangian approach are methods of increasing numerical efficiency for large systems.

                   dynamical behaviors of a 3D rod moving on a rough
                   surface with so-called Painlev{\~A}? paradox. The
                   condition for the occurrence of the Painlev{\~A}?
                   paradox in the rod is studied according to the
                   theoretical results obtained from LCP{\^a}??s method
                   for spatial multibody systems. Numerical results
                   obtained by inserting a compliant contact model into
                   the rigid body model present a support for the
                   assumption that a tangential impact is related to the
                   spatial paradoxical situations. Furthermore, the
                   tangential impact is analyzed by using the
                   Darboux{\^a}??Keller{\^a}??s shock dynamics and are
                   found with the same properties as the one in the planar
                   rod: A tangential stick appears at the contact point
                   during the impulsive process. With the help of the
                   Stronge{\^a}??s coefficient, an impact rule is
                   developed to describe the dynamical behaviors of the 3D
                   rod with paradoxical situations. Comparisons between
                   numerical results obtained from Darboux{\^a}??s model
                   and the ones obtained from the compliant contact model

	Abstract = {In the context of simulating the frictional contact dynamics of large systems of rigid bodies, this paper reviews a novel method for solving large cone complementarity problems by means of a fixed-point iteration algorithm. The method is an extension of the Gauss{\^a}??Seidel and Gauss{\^a}??Jacobi methods with over-relaxation for symmetric convex linear complementarity problems. Convergent under fairly standard assumptions, the method is implemented in a parallel framework by using a single instruction multiple data computation paradigm promoted by the Compute Unified Device Architecture library for graphical processing unit programming. The framework supports the simulation of problems with more than one million bodies in contact. Simulation thus becomes a viable tool for investigating the dynamics of complex systems such as ground vehicles running on sand, powder composites, and granular material flow.},

	Abstract = {For decades, rigid body dynamics has been used in several active research fields to simulate the behavior of completely undeformable, rigid bodies. Due to the focus of the simulations to either high physical accuracy or real time environments, the state-of-the-art algorithms cannot be used in excess of several thousand rigid bodies. Either the complexity of the algorithms would result in infeasible runtimes, or the simulation could no longer satisfy the real time aspects. In this paper we present a novel approach for large-scale rigid body dynamics simulations. The presented algorithm enables for the first time rigid body simulations of several million rigid bodies. We describe in detail the parallel rigid body algorithm and its necessary extensions for a large-scale MPI parallelization and show some results by means of a particular simulation scenario.},

Starting with the mathematical framework, bi- and unilateral contacts including friction are introduced. A general concept for the geometrical description of contacting surfaces is presented. Applying the numerical methods developed for non-smooth systems to different examples in academia and industry, the overall framework proves to be robust and efficient.},

	Abstract = {A particular class of mechanical systems concerns diffuse non smooth problems for which unilateral conditions may occur within the whole studied domain. For instance, when contact and friction occur as interactions between a large number of bodies, such as for granular media, or with tensegrity structures, [14], when cable slackening may occur on the whole structure. When such large scale structures are studied, their numerical simulationmay take advantage of using domain decomposition (DD) solvers.We do not consider here an outer loop for dealing with non linearities and non smoothness that lead to a series of linear problems, each of them being solved with a classical DD solver as a black box, but we focus on algorithms that allow us to tackle the non smoothness issue at the subdomain level, with a single iterative loop. Such approaches have already be designed for mechanical assemblings with a limited number of unilateral conditions, [5, 6, 7], or for multicontact situations, [1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 15].},
