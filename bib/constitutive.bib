abstract="This paper describes the results of an extended version of a new explicit algorithm recently developed by Nemat-Nasser and co-workers for stiff phenomenological finite-deformation rate-independent elastoplasticity and rate-dependent elastoviscoplasticity. The extended algorithm incorporates effects of large strains and rotations, while continuing to include possible combined isotropic and kinematic workhardening, as well as thermal softening and noncoaxiality of the plastic strain rate and the deviatoric stress. It is based on a plastic-predictor-followed-by-elastic-corrector methodology and produces accurate and stable results, which are practically (i.e., in a finite-element application) independent of the magnitude of the time or strain increment. It is shown that the algorithm provides accurate results for relatively large strain and rotation increments. The result is exact for rigid-body rotation. It also works well for problems with nonproportional loading.",

The results are illustrated by means of several examples which show that the technique is incredibly accurate and always stable, essentially independent of the magnitude of the time or strain increment. For implementation in large-scale finite-element computer codes, a simplified version of the new algorithm is proposed, its effectiveness is illustrated, and its relation to the radial-return method is examined.",

title="Explicit constitutive algorithm for large-strain, large-strain-rate elastic-viscoplasticity",
journal="Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering",
year="1992",
volume="95",
issue="2",
pages="205--219",
abstract="A simple, robust, stable, and very accurate algorithm is presented for explicit calculations of large-strain, large-strain-rate elastic-viscoplasticity. It produces near-exact solutions over any given large or small time increment in literally any number of timesteps, i.e., as few as one, and as many as desired; this is a particularly attractive feature which renders the algorithm suitable for implementation in large-scale, vectorized, explicit finite element codes. The performance of this algorithm is illustrated, using a simple elastic-viscoplastic constitutive model which includes possible noncoaxiality of the plastic strain rate and the stress tensors. Both the power-law model with the rate sensitivity exponent ranging from 5 to 100 or more, and the Johnson-Cook model are considered, including isotropic and kinematic strain hardening and thermal softening effects. The results are compared with the effective (rate) tangent moduli method, and it is shown that while this latter method may require, for reasonable accuracy, many timesteps over a given time increment or strain-rate history, the new algorithm predicts the near-exact solutions by only a few timesteps (even one), no matter how large the total time increment may be.",

abstract="This paper summarizes the results of a recent breakthrough in explicit constitutive computational algorithms for finite-element calculations of large-deformation rate-independent elastoplasticity, using the example of the J2 yield condition and flow rule with isotropic hardening. The new algorithm provides a direct, explicit, and always nearly exact estimate of the yield surface and all stress components, for any prescribed deformation increment (large or small) in one single step with no iterations, or in any desired number of substeps. The algorithm does not depend on radial return, and can accommodate nonsmooth yield surfaces. This generalization is also briefly discussed.",
