                   physics, biology and economics. An expanded list of
                   computer codes in an appendix and more
                   computer-solvable exercises in the text reflect
                   Strang?s interest in computational linear algebra. Many
                   exercises appear in the sections and in the chapter
                   reviews. Exercises are simple but instructive. },
