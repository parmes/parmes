                   optimize the location of the collocation point (where
                   plastic consistency is enforced) in order to achieve
                   high accuracy for virtually unlimited sizes of the time

                   [?t/2, ?t], which automatically guarantees
                   unconditional stability. The optimal weighting

                   error in non-linear finite element analysis which is
                   caused by the use of finite load steps. In contrast to
                   most recent schemes, the proposed technique is
                   non-iterative and treats the governing load-deflection
                   relations as a system of ordinary differential
                   equations. This permits the governing equations to be
                   integrated adaptively where the step size is controlled
                   by monitoring the local truncation error. The latter is
                   measured by computing the difference between two
                   estimates of the displacement incremeats for each load
                   step, with the initial estimate being found from the
                   fast-order Euler scheme and the improved estimate being
                   found from the second-order modified Euler scheme. If
                   the local truncation error exceeds a specified
                   tolerance, then the load step is abandoned and the
                   integration ts repeated with a smaller load step whose
                   size ts found by local extrapolation. Local
                   extrapolation is also used to predict the size of the
                   next load step following a successful update. In order
                   to control not only the local load path error, but also
                   the global load path error, the proposed scheme
                   incorporates a correction for the unbalanced forces.
                   Overall, the cost of the automatic error control is
                   modest since it requires only one additional equation
                   solution for each successful load step. Because the
                   solution scheme is non-iterative and founded on
                   successful techniques for integrating systems of
                   ordinary differential equations, it is particularly
                   robust To illustrate the ability of the scheme to
                   constrain the load path error to lie near a desired
                   tolerance, detailed results are presented for a variety

                   a certain velocity norm, as closely as possible,

                   present exposition overviews new and recent advances
                   describing a standardized formal theory towards the
                   evolution, classification, characterization and generic
                   design of time discretized operators for
                   transient/dynamic applications. Of fundamental
                   importance in the present exposition are the
                   developments encompassing the evolution of time
                   discretized operators leading to the theoretical design
                   of computational algorithms and their subsequent
                   classification and characterization. And, the overall
                   developments are new and significantly different from
                   the way traditional modal type and a wide variety of
                   step-by-step time marching approaches which we are
                   mostly familiar with have been developed and described
                   in the research literature and in standard text books
                   over the years. The theoretical ideas and basis towards
                   the evolution of a generalized methodology and
                   formulations emanate under the umbrella and framework
                   and are explained via a generalized time weighted
                   philosophy encompassing the semi-discretized equations
                   pertinent to transient/dynamic systems. It is herein
                   hypothesized that integral operators and the associated
                   representations and a wide variety of the so-called
                   integration operators pertain to and emanate from the
                   same family, with the burden which is being carried by
                   a virtual field or weighted time field specifically
                   introduced for the time discretization is strictly
                   enacted in a mathematically consistent manner so as to
                   first permit obtaining the adjoint operator of the
                   original semi-discretized equation system.
                   Subsequently, the selection or burden carried by the
                   virtual or weighted time fields originally introduced
                   to facilitate the time discretization process
                   determines the formal development and outcome of
                   ``exact integral operators'', ``approximate integral
                   operators'', including providing avenues leading to the
                   design of new computational algorithms which have not
                   been exploited and/or explored to-date and the recovery
                   of most of the existing algorithms, and also bridging
                   the relationships systematically leading to the
                   evolution of a wide variety of ``integration
                   operators''. Thus, the overall developments not only
                   serve as a prelude towards the formal developments for
                   ``exact integral operators'', but also demonstrate that
                   the resulting ``approximate integral operators'' and a
                   wide variety of ``new and existing integration
                   operators and known methods'' are simply subsets of the
                   generalizations of a standardized Wp-Family, and
                   emanate from the principles presented herein. The
                   developments first leading to integral operators in
                   time, and the resulting consequences then
                   systematically leading to not only providing new
                   avenues but additionally also explaining a wide variety
                   of generalized integration operators in time of which
                   single-step time integration operators and various
                   widely recognized algorithms which we are familiar are
                   simply subsets, the associated multi-step time
                   integration operators, and a class of finite element in
                   time integration operators, and their relationships are
                   particularly addressed. The theoretical design
                   developments encompass and explain a variety of time
                   discretized operators, the recovery of various original
                   methods of algorithmic development, and the development
                   of new computational algorithms which have not been
                   exploited and/or explored to-date, and furthermore,
                   permit time discretized operators to be uniquely
                   classified and characterized by algorithmic markers.
                   The resulting and so-called discrete numerically
                   assigned [DNA] algorithmic markers not only serve as a
                   prelude towards providing a standardized formal theory
                   of development of time discretized operators and forum
                   for selecting and identifying time discretized
                   operators, but also permit lucid communication when
                   referring to various time discretized operators. That
                   which constitutes characterization of time discretized
                   operators are the so-called DNA algorithmic markers
                   which essentially comprise of both: (i) the weighted
                   time fields introduced for enacting the time
                   discretization process, and (ii) the corresponding
                   conditions (if any) these weighted time fields impose
                   (dictate) upon the approximations for the dependent
                   field variables and updates in the theoretical

                   stamping process simulation attaching spring-back
                   calculation, is the dynamic effect. In order to
                   minimize the dynamic effects, some kinds of loading
                   algorithms should be performed. The enhancement of
                   these is proposed in this paper, as well as making up
                   for a deficiency that current damping models have when
                   used to reduce the dynamic effects. Essential
                   conditions that can be followed to generate an ideal

                   diagonal lumped mass on which strictly mass
                   proportional damping is based. While the damping
                   coefficient can be adaptively determined on the basis
                   of the estimated frequency of the predominant response,
                   local changes in stiffness, often associated with
                   changing contact conditions, can cause abrupt changes
                   in the damping coefficient. This can substantially
                   impede the progress of the solution, particularly when
                   deformations involve large translations or rotations of
                   parts of the system. A modification to the mass

                   L-stable (FDEL) algorithm which is unconditionally
                   consistent and does not require non-linear iterations
                   within each time step. From the established measures
                   for comparable algorithms, simply for illustration
                   purposes, the resulting design of the FDEL formulation
                   is then compared with the commonly advocated explicit
                   central difference method and the implicit Newmark
                   average acceleration method (alternately, the same
                   conclusion holds true against controllable numerically
                   dissipative algorithms) which pertain to the class of
                   linear multi-step (LMS) methods for assessing both
                   linear and non-linear dynamic cases. The conclusions
                   that the proposed new design of the FDEL algorithm
                   which is a direct consequence of the present notion of
                   design spaces and measures, is the most effective
                   algorithm to-date to our knowledge in comparison to the
                   class of second-order accurate algorithms pertaining to
                   LMS methods for routine and general non-linear dynamic
                   situations is finally drawn through rigorous numerical
                   experiments. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.",

  abstract       = "In this paper, the numerical stability and accuracy of
                   Precise Time Step Integration Method are discussed in
                   detail. It is shown that the method is conditionally
                   stable and it has inherent algorithmic damping,
                   algorithmic period error and algorithmic amplitude
                   decay. However for discretized structural models, it is
                   relatively easy for this time integration scheme to
                   satisfy the stability conditions and required accuracy.
                   Based on the above results, the optimum values of the
                   truncation order L and bisection order N are presented.
                   The Gauss quadrature method is used to improve the
                   accuracy of the Precise Time Step Integration Method.
                   Finally, two numerical examples are presented to show
                   the feasibility of this improvement method. ? 2006
